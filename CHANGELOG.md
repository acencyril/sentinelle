# Changelog

All notable changes to Sentinelle.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] — 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- Remaining French strings in the check command, the configuration descriptions
  and the missing-configuration error.
- `branch-alias` aligned on `0.3.x-dev`.

### Note for anyone upgrading from 0.2

⚠ `SENTINELLE_ALERTE_EMAIL` became `SENTINELLE_ALERT_EMAIL`, and **Flex will not
rename it for you**. It never overwrites an existing `.env` entry, so the old
variable stays and the new one is never added. You get
`Environment variable not found: "SENTINELLE_ALERT_EMAIL"` with no hint as to
why. Rename it by hand.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-01

### ⚠ Breaking

The whole codebase moved to English. **Configuration keys, table names, route
names and the admin path all changed.** Upgrading from 0.2 requires editing your
configuration and running a migration.

There is no automatic upgrade path, and that is deliberate: silently renaming
tables under a running site is worse than an error message that tells you what
to do.

#### Configuration keys

| 0.2 | 0.3 |
|---|---|
| `essai` | `dry_run` |
| `alerte` | `alert` |
| `alerte.destinataire` | `alert.recipient` |
| `alerte.expediteur` | `alert.sender` |
| `alerte.nom_expediteur` | `alert.sender_name` |
| `alerte.nom_du_site` | `alert.site_name` |
| `alerte.repit` | `alert.cooldown` |
| `acces` | `access` |
| `acces.prefixe` | `access.prefix` |
| `acces.gabarit_parent` | `access.parent_template` |
| `acces.route_retour` | `access.back_route` |
| `seuils` | `thresholds` |
| `seuils.rafale` | `thresholds.burst` |
| `seuils.rafale_fenetre` | `thresholds.burst_window` |
| `seuils.bruteforce_fenetre` | `thresholds.bruteforce_window` |
| `jamais_bloquer` | `never_block` |
| `jamais_bloquer.chemins` | `never_block.paths` |
| `jamais_bloquer.prestataires` | `never_block.providers` |
| `motifs_critiques` | `critical_patterns` |
| `ignorer` | `ignore` |

#### Environment variable

`SENTINELLE_ALERTE_EMAIL` → `SENTINELLE_ALERT_EMAIL`

#### Tables

`sentinelle_visite` → `sentinelle_visit`
`sentinelle_ip_bloquee` → `sentinelle_blocked_ip`

Run `doctrine:migrations:diff` then `migrate`. **The generated migration drops
the old tables** — export your data first if you want to keep it.

#### Commands

`sentinelle:purger` → `sentinelle:purge`
`sentinelle:verifier` → `sentinelle:check`

#### Routes and admin path

`/admin/activite` → `/admin/activity`, and the route names
`sentinelle_activite`, `_bloquer`, `_debloquer` become `sentinelle_activity`,
`_block`, `_unblock`.

### Changed
- Class names: `IpBloquee` → `BlockedIp`, `Visite` → `Visit`,
  `AlerteSecurite` → `SecurityAlert`, `ActiviteController` → `ActivityController`,
  and their repositories accordingly.
- Log messages, dashboard labels, email contents and command output are now in
  English.

### Note
Inline comments remain in French. They explain *why* each safeguard exists, and
several come from real incidents — that reasoning is the most valuable part of
this code, and translating it badly would be worse than leaving it.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- PHP constraint lowered to `>=8.1`. Nothing in the code required 8.2, and
  Symfony 6.4 runs on 8.1: asking for more excluded projects for no reason.
- `branch-alias` aligned on `0.2.x-dev`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-31

### Added
- **Dry-run mode** (`essai: true`): Sentinelle detects, logs and alerts, but
  blocks nothing. Every avoided block is logged along with what would have been
  decided, duration included.

  > *A mechanism you cannot try without risk will not be tried — it will be
  > installed and switched off at the first incident.*

- **`sentinelle:verifier` command**: checks that the cache answers, that both
  tables exist, that the allowlist is not empty and that alerts have a valid
  recipient.

  Each of these is a way the mechanism can fail **silently** — without a cache,
  counters always return zero, no threshold ever fires, and detection is
  disarmed without anything saying so.

- `CHANGELOG.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Dashboard screenshot in both READMEs.

### Changed
- **Symfony 8** compatibility.
- English README by default, French in `README.fr.md`. *Packagist displays
  `README.md`, and the PHP ecosystem is English-speaking.*
- Both README hooks aligned on the package description.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- An import left on the old namespace after extraction, causing a
  `ClassNotFoundError` on every request — and not a single line logged.
- The whole body of the logger is now protected, not just the write. On
  `kernel.terminate` the response has already been sent: an exception went
  nowhere, the site answered 200 and the table stayed empty.

  > *A logger that can fail silently is worse than no logger at all: you believe
  > it is running.*

- The controller no longer extends `AbstractController`, which expects a
  restricted container built by autoconfiguration — a mechanism disabled in a
  bundle where everything is declared by hand. Dependencies are now injected
  explicitly.
- Journal filter: `tout` and `all` meant the same thing without knowing about
  each other, a leftover from a partial translation.
- The matched pattern and the query string are shown in the journal. Without
  them, two exploitation attempts appeared as two identical rows.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- `getPath()`: without it, `@SentinelleBundle/config/…` pointed at
  `src/config/`, and neither routes nor services would load.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-31

First release, extracted from an application running in production.

### Fixed before release
- `Bundle` instead of `AbstractBundle`: the latter carries its own configuration
  and **silently ignores** any extension class written alongside it. The bundle
  loaded perfectly, with an empty configuration tree.

### Features
- Logs every request on `kernel.terminate`, after the response has been sent —
  which is also the only moment the status code is known.
- Detection: code execution, SQL injection, directory traversal, Log4Shell,
  deserialisation; probes; brute force.
- Progressive blocking: 24 hours, 7 days, then permanent. Blocks expire, and
  that is deliberate — most scanning addresses are compromised machines or
  recycled cloud addresses.
- **Refuses to block a critical provider**, automatically and manually,
  recognised by reverse DNS.
- Email alert, at most one per address per hour.
- Dashboard showing each address's owner.
- `sentinelle:purger` command, without which strike counters never reset.
